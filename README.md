You will neeed to unzip an archive coz I don't know how to upload folder which contains more then 100 files
Also the world map I've done using this article https://towardsdatascience.com/a-complete-guide-to-an-interactive-geographical-map-using-python-f4c5197e23e0
I don't thnk that it is plagiarism but anyway link is attached
Also map is not showed in jupyter note book, thats why I've uploaded html version too
